# Sudoko-Puzzle
A program that aim to solve 5 sudoku puzzle using multiple search algorithms

The program will solved 5 custom 9x9 sudoku puzzle using a combination of the following algorithms, Minimum remaining value, First Avaialble, Backtracking and Arc consistency.

The inspriration for this program is demonstrating how algorithms used for Constraint Satisfaction Problem can be used to solve a real life puzzle.

# Running the program:

Running the program will show 5 solved 9x9 sudoku puzzle.

There is also an option to receive a plotted graph to show how different combination of algorithms can change the running time for solving the problem.
